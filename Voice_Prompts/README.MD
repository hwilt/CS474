# Submission Questions
I used your code from the voice prompts as a basis for the voice code in the game<br>
I did not have any questions<br>
I did not work with a buddy<br>
All code was written by me execpt the listen method in the voice class which uses your starter code<br>
It took me about 6 maybe 7 hours of thinking/coding to complete the project<br>
I did enjoy the assignment, I thought making the game was fun and using your voice to control the game was interesting<br>
No other concerns


## How to run the code:
Make sure your microphone is on and have the dependencies installed.<br>In your terminal: `python main.py`

### Dependencies:
Portaudio, libespeak, pyaudio, pyttsx3, and speechrecognition:<br>
In your terminal run these commands:<br>
