I watched the Mother of All Demos by Doug Engelbart, took notes, and answered questions about the video.
Answers to the questions are found in the MOAD_Dicussion.pdf file
I did not work with anyone else
Everything was done by me
It took me abou 3-4 hours to complete this assignment
The assignment was good, I thought the video was a bit long and boring at times but others, I thought that Engelbart and his team were doing some very clever and important stuff.
No concerns about the assignment.
